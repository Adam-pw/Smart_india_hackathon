what we have done about problem and our ideology 
-------------------------------------------------
We tried to present a place for students to search for different scholarships available according to their qualifications and acedemic achievements.
below is a map/ss/photo representing the sorting page which includes 12th marks, competitve exams given, category, etc.
 
Our idealogy include making students aware of tons of scholarship available as a kick start for financially deprived ones. About 60% of them arent aware of 
scholarships which leads them to quit their dreams. 

A place where knowledge about scholarship wont be confined, but you would be given diversity about searcing to excel your mindset a way ahead to carrier.
